            Divvy is a, quite simply, an expense splitting application. However. There are a few key features
            that make Divvy stand out. Let's go over them now.

            <h2 class="font-bold text-[clamp(1rem,5vw,1.5rem)] text-amber-500">Split or Divvy up</h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                It is very easy to tally up expenses and divide them up equally between a specific number of people.
                Indeed, Divvy excels at this task. However, the true power of Divvy comes when you decide to
                <em>Divvy up</em> expenses. This means that specifically assign expenses to each member and Divvy will
                handle the rest. Intelligently calculating expenses based on the number of people assigned to each.

            <h2 class="font-bold text-[clamp(1rem,5vw,1.5rem)] text-amber-500">Reports and Data</h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Divvy will generate a report for each of your Divvy's and present the data clean and easy to understand
                format. Whether you're just simply splitting expenses equally or Divvying up expenses, Divvy will always
                generate a report that you can then save and open at any time.

            <h2 class="font-bold text-[clamp(1rem,5vw,1.5rem)] text-amber-500">Local vs Cloud</h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                As mentioned previously, your reports can be saved and opened at any time. How you choose to save your
                reports is up to you. If you are not signed in, Divvy will store your reports locally on your device by
                default. This of course means that you can use Divvy without needing to create an account. However,
                there are some caveats to this.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-8">Firstly, reports saved locally are tied to the device you used at the time you saved the
                report. This
                means that if you saved the report while using your phone you will <strong>not</strong> see that report
                on
                any other device expect for your phone. This logic also applied to the browser you used to save the
                report.
                Reports saved on Google Chrome will not show up on Microsoft Edge for example.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-8">
                If having access to your reports across devices and browsers is important to you, consider creating a
                free account to have all your reports saved in the Cloud and available across all devices and browsers.
